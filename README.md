# GasSplitter

![Build](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen)

GasSplitter is a simple C program that helps you split gasoline expenses among multiple travelers.  
It calculates the total fuel cost based on the distance, fuel consumption, and fuel price, then divides 
it by the number of participants.


# Usage

When you run GasSplitter, it will ask you for the following inputs:
1. Total kilometers of the trip
2. Number of travelers
3. Average fuel consumption (l/100km)
4. Fuel price (€ per liter)

Example session:

Welcome to GasSplitter. Please, enter total km: 250
Please, enter number of travelers: 3
Please, enter average gas usage (l/100km): 6.5
Finally, enter gas price (€): 1.75
Your trip total price is 28.44€, and the price per traveler is 9.48€.
Thank you for using GasSplitter. Safe travels!
